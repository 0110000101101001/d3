Data from the [Minnesota Population Center](http://ipums.org/). Use the arrow
keys to change the displayed year. The blue bars are the male population for
each five-year age bracket, while the pink bars are the female population; the
bars are partially transparent so that you can see how they overlap, unlike the
traditional [side-by-side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid)
display which makes it difficult to compare the relative distribution of the
sexes.
